# W22_CIS3760_Team10

A simple flask backend that has a search functionality (functionality imported from previous CLI)
Very basic react front end that consists of a form with a textbox and a button. In the textbox, enter your search parameters e.g. cis x x w, hist x 1.00 x, acct 3 0.5 f.
For a temporary time, users will need to use 'x' to respresent a blank parameter. Ensure you include all 4 parameters in the correct order in order
for search to work (course_code level_year course_weight time_offered). For the time being result data is displayed in JSON format
