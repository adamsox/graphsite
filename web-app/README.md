# Configuring NGINX on the server

1. Confirm node and npm are installed on the server using 
 node --version
 npm --version

2. Check if nginx is installed using the command : nginx -v
2.1 If installed proceed to the next step otherwise installed nginx via command: sudo apt install nginx

3.Following installation go to the servers IP address located at your servers IP address in our case its http://131.104.49.112/ to check for boilerplate nginx site
    -to get the ip address of your server type the command:  curl ifconfig.me
    

4. Navigate to the react project root and run the command: npm run build
    -this will take your react project and convert it into a build folder that can be deployed on nginx

5. To get nginx to server the build folder you need to move the build folder using the following command:
sudo cp -r /locationOfBuildFolder/build/. /var/www/html

6. We need to configure the config file for nginx to host our build folder use the follwing command to open the config file for editing: sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default . The default configuraiton of NGINX works for our webserver so there need be no modifications.

7. To see changes take effect restart the NGINX service by running the command : sudo service nginx restart

8. Navigate to http://131.104.49.112/ to see the hosted react project









# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.



See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
